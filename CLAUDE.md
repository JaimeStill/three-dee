# Web Game Development Repository

A hands-on learning repository for Three.js game development fundamentals using Vite and modern JavaScript (ES6+).

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains incremental learning projects that follow the curriculum outlined in `PROJECT.md`. Each development session focuses on specific concepts through guided exploration and hands-on experimentation.

**IMPORTANT: The PROJECT.md roadmap should be strictly followed unless the developer explicitly directs otherwise.** Sessions proceed sequentially through the curriculum phases, building on previous concepts.

## Roles and Workflow

### The Developer's Role (Jaime - Human)
- Executes the development sessions by following the implementation guides
- Experiments with parameters, breaks things, and builds intuition
- Takes notes on discoveries and "aha" moments
- Drives the creative direction and exploration depth
- Determines when ready to move to the next concept

### Claude's Role (AI Assistant)
- Creates focused implementation guides for each session
- Provides context and explanations for concepts being explored
- Answers questions and clarifies misunderstandings during developer's exploration
- Documents completed sessions and prepares materials for the next session
- Uses context7 MCP server to ensure guides use latest library practices
- **Not** the primary code writer - the developer learns by doing, not by watching

### Development Session Flow

1. **Planning Phase** (Claude + Developer)
   - Discuss which concept(s) to explore based on the developer's progress
   - Determine appropriate scope for available time (typically 1-2 hours)
   - Identify specific learning objectives for the session

2. **Guide Creation** (Claude)
   - Create implementation guide with:
     - Conceptual overview (what and why)
     - Step-by-step implementation instructions
     - Key code examples with explanations
     - Suggested experiments and variations
     - Expected outcomes and common pitfalls

3. **Hands-On Exploration** (Developer)
   - Follow the guide to build the initial implementation
   - Experiment with variations and parameters
   - Test understanding by modifying behavior
   - Take notes on interesting discoveries
   - Ask Claude for clarification as needed

4. **Documentation & Preparation** (Claude)
   - Update LOG.md with session details (date, duration, what was built, key learnings, experiments, reflections)
   - Check off the completed session in PROJECT.md (add ✅ to section heading)
   - Preview the next session from PROJECT.md in LOG.md
   - Update session README.md with final implementation notes if needed
   - Document any deviations or creative additions the developer made
   - Prepare next session's scaffolding and guide when developer is ready

### Session Naming Convention

Sessions are numbered sequentially with descriptive names:
- `session-01-essential-foundation` - Setup, basic scene, lighting
- `session-02-animation-loop` - Render loop and time-based animation
- `session-03-geometry-materials` - Different shapes and material properties
- etc.

### Each Session Contains

1. **README.md** - Implementation guide with:
   - Learning objectives
   - Conceptual overview
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Experiment suggestions
   - Reference links

2. **Source files** - Minimal scaffold:
   - `index.html` - Basic HTML structure
   - `main.ts` - TypeScript implementation code
   - `style.css` - Minimal styling for full-screen canvas
   - `package.json` - Vite + Three.js dependencies
   - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration (auto-generated by Vite)

3. **notes.md** (optional) - The developer's personal notes:
   - Interesting discoveries
   - Parameter values that worked well
   - Questions for future exploration
   - Creative variations tried

## Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast dev server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and built-in TypeScript support
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **TypeScript** - Adds type safety and superior IntelliSense for Three.js API exploration

### Why TypeScript?
- **Three.js has excellent type definitions** - Get autocomplete for every method, property, and parameter
- **Catch mistakes immediately** - Typos and incorrect API usage caught before runtime
- **Zero configuration with Vite** - TypeScript works out-of-the-box with no setup
- **Accelerates learning** - Discover APIs through IntelliSense instead of constantly checking documentation
- **Minimal complexity** - For this project, you only need basic type annotations
- **Three.js has a massive API** - Types guide you through 100+ classes and their methods

### Context7 Integration

This repository uses the context7 MCP server to fetch up-to-date documentation for:
- **Vite** (`/vitejs/vite/v7.0.0`) - Latest build tool practices
- **Three.js** (`/mrdoob/three.js`) - Current API and patterns

**CRITICAL: Claude must ONLY use context7 through subagents (Task tool), NEVER directly in the main conversation.**

Context7 returns extremely large documentation that will rapidly consume the main conversation's context window. Subagents have their own isolated context windows and can process the documentation, then return only the distilled, relevant information back to the main conversation.

When creating implementation guides, Claude should launch a subagent to query context7 and return specific code examples, API patterns, or setup instructions needed for that session.

## Development Session Guidelines

### Scoping Sessions

**Good session scope** (1-2 hours):
- 2-3 related concepts
- 1 main implementation
- 2-4 variations to experiment with
- Clear learning objectives

**Too ambitious**:
- 5+ concepts in one session
- Complex systems requiring deep architectural decisions
- Trying to build a complete game in one sitting

**Too minimal**:
- Single trivial concept with no room for exploration
- No variations or experiments
- Concepts that could be combined with others

### When the Developer Should Ask Claude for Help

**Developer should ask:**
- "Why does this parameter affect the scene this way?"
- "I tried X and got Y, but expected Z - what's happening?"
- "What are some interesting variations I could try with this concept?"
- "Can you explain how [concept] relates to [other concept]?"

**Developer should NOT ask:**
- "Can you write the code for me?" (defeats the learning purpose)
- "Make my game better" (too vague, the developer is the creative director)

**Claude should proactively:**
- Clarify concepts when the developer seems stuck
- Suggest experiments when the developer has completed the basic implementation
- Point out common pitfalls before the developer hits them
- Provide context on why certain patterns are used

## Typical Development Session Example

### Session Start
1. Developer: "Ready to explore lighting today"
2. Claude: Asks clarifying questions about time, specific interests
3. Claude: Creates implementation guide in session directory
4. Developer: Reviews guide, asks any clarification questions

### During Session
5. Developer: Follows guide to implement basic lighting setup
6. Developer: Experiments with different light types and positions
7. Developer: "Why does my sphere look flat even with a light?"
8. Claude: Explains material types and which respond to light
9. Developer: Continues experimenting with materials and lighting

### Session End
10. Developer: "I got it working, tried 5 different light combinations"
11. Claude: Documents session in LOG.md, checks off in PROJECT.md, updates session README if needed
12. Developer: Takes a break or continues to next session (Claude prepares next session when ready)

## Learning Philosophy

From `PROJECT.md`:
1. **Build incrementally** - Master each concept before combining them
2. **Experiment freely** - Modify parameters, break things, observe results
3. **Refactor often** - Revisit early code with new knowledge
4. **Start ugly** - Procedural geometry doesn't need to be beautiful initially
5. **Profile performance** - Use browser dev tools to understand bottlenecks

**Key principle**: The goal is not to rush to a complete game, but to understand each system deeply enough to apply it confidently in any context.

## Progress Tracking

Session progress, learnings, and development milestones are tracked in `LOG.md` at the repository root.

### Session Closeout Steps

After each completed session, Claude should:

1. **Update LOG.md** with:
   - Date and duration
   - What was built
   - Key learnings and insights
   - Experiments conducted
   - Technical notes (bugs found, fixes applied)
   - Developer's reflections
   - Next session preview (from PROJECT.md)

2. **Update PROJECT.md**:
   - Add ✅ to the completed session heading

3. **Update session README.md** (if needed):
   - Add any corrections or clarifications discovered during the session
   - Document any deviations or creative additions the developer made

4. **Prepare next session** (when developer is ready):
   - Create next session directory and scaffolding files
   - Write implementation guide following PROJECT.md curriculum

5. **Follow the roadmap**:
   - The PROJECT.md curriculum should be strictly followed unless the developer explicitly requests a deviation

## Questions and Iteration

This workflow will evolve as we learn what works best for the developer's learning style. After the first few sessions, we may:
- Adjust session scope based on the developer's pace
- Add new conventions as needs emerge
- Modify guide structure based on what's most helpful

The developer can suggest changes to the workflow at any time.
