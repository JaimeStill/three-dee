# Three.js Game Development Learning Repository

A hands-on learning journey through Three.js and 3D game development fundamentals, built incrementally through focused development sessions.

## Purpose

This repository documents a structured approach to mastering Three.js by building small, concept-focused projects. Each session explores specific techniques through guided implementation and hands-on experimentation, progressing from basic rendering to complete game systems.

## Structure

- **`PROJECT.md`** - Complete learning curriculum and roadmap
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Instructions for AI assistant collaboration and repository conventions
- **`LOG.md`** - Development log tracking progress, learnings, and reflections
- **`session-XX-*/`** - Individual learning sessions, each containing:
  - Implementation guide (README.md)
  - Working code examples
  - Personal notes and experiments

## Technology Stack

- **Vite** - Fast development server with hot module replacement
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library with WebGL rendering
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced IntelliSense for API exploration

## Philosophy

This repository prioritizes deep understanding over rapid completion. Each session focuses on thoroughly exploring 2-3 related concepts through experimentation and iteration, allowing time for concepts to settle before advancing.

**Goal:** Build intuition and confidence with each system, not just copy code.

## Current Progress

See `LOG.md` for detailed session notes and learning outcomes.
